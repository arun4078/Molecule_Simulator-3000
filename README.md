# Molecule_Simulator üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Ctrl+Alt+Delivers


### Team Members

### Project Description
Presenting The Hydro-Metric Extrapolator, a whimsical yet useless app that uses your phone's camera, the app "measures" the water in your bottle, but instead of using conventional units, we use distance to measure the content. It calculates the total end-to-end distance of all the water molecules in your drink, giving you a completely impractical, yet technically accurate, value. This project is for anyone who's ever wondered how many lightyears of H2O molecules their drink contains.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How do you estimate the amount of liquid in a bottle (750 ml / 1 L) in the least practical way imaginable?


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Measure it in light-years by calculating how far all the water molecules would stretch if lined up end-to-end. Utterly useless. Perfectly accurate.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- dart
- Flutter
- Libraries used: .camera (for capturing images using device camera)
                  .video_player (for displaying loading animation)
                  .flutter_launcher_icons (for setting custom app icons)
- [Tools used]:   .Android Studio / VS Code (development)
                  .Flutter SDK
                  .Dart SDK

For Hardware:
-Main components: Android phone or iOS device with working camera
-Specifications: Minimum 2 GB RAM, Android 8.0+ or iOS 13+, rear camera
-Tools required: USB cable (for debugging), computer with Flutter installed

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation

When you first launch the app, the app asks for camera permissions. The user then aligns the camera to the bottle using the bottle_outline overlay and clicks capture.

Then the user moves the blue line to the level of water, and click begin

If the resulting distance is above 1 lightyear, the app uses the length contraction equation.
